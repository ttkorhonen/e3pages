ESS' EPICS Environment (e3) is a design concept and a toolkit intended to a) facilitate development by abstracting away some of the low-level complexities intrinsic to large EPICS implementations (primarily dependency management), and b) allow for more manageable quality control of released modules as well as IOCs. It allows for easily building EPICS modules directly from source and automagically resolves module dependencies, and allows for site specific modifications to EPICS modules without needing to directly modify source trees.
