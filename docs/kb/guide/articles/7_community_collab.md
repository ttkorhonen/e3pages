# Article: Community collaboration

e3 is a custom set of tools designed to facilitate the deployment and maintaintance of EPICS environments. Since at its heart, this is still an EPICS environment that uses tools and functionality built by member of the EPICS community, it is important to know how to work with that community in order to get help, to troubleshoot, and to contribute in order to give back to said community.

## EPICS Community resources

The main EPICS [website](https://epics-controls.org/) is the best source for all things EPICS. There you can find:
* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/documents/epics-faq/)
* [Documentation](https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/documents/) for different versions of EPICS base
* A list of [projects](https://epics-controls.org/epics-users/projects/) that use EPICS
* [News and events](https://epics-controls.org/news-and-events/), listing upcoming and past events, as well as information about the latests releases of EPICS

And of course, much more.

Note that e3 is designed to work with the EPICS base 7 series, and we have dropped support for base 3.x.

## Asking for help

If you cannot find the information that you are looking for within the links above, then one can look to the [tech-talk](https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/index.php) mailing list. This is an active mailing list which allows you to ask the broader EPICS community for help and information. For example, if you are struggling to build or install a custom EPICS module, then this can be a good place to look for help. If you are looking to see if anyone has already developed support for a piece of hardware, then this again is a good place to look.

Of course, as a part of a community, it is also a good place to offer your help and experience in return!
