# e3.bash

Included with the main e3 repository are a pair of scripts, `e3_building_config.bash` and `e3.bash`. They can be used
to automate setting up a local  e3 environment. In particular, they can do all of the following.

* Set which version of EPICS base/require you would like to install
* Decide on the install location
* Build and install EPICS base with the patches needed to use e3
* Build and install require
* Build and install groups of modules

An example of the above is the following.

```bash
$ bash e3_building_config.bash -b 7.0.4 -r 3.3.0 -t /opt/epics
$ bash e3.bash base
$ bash e3.bash req
$ bash e3.bash -c mod
```

## Configuring EPICS base/require versions

Configuration for your local install is done with `e3_building_config.bash`.
