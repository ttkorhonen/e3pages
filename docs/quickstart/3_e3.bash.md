# e3.bash

Included with the main e3 repository are a pair of scripts, `e3_building_config.bash` and `e3.bash`. They can be used
to automate setting up a local  e3 environment. In particular, they can do all of the following.

* Set which version of EPICS base/require you would like to install
* Decide on the install location
* Build and install EPICS base with the patches needed to use e3
* Build and install require
* Build and install groups of modules

An example of the above is the following.

```bash
$ bash e3_building_config.bash -b 7.0.4 -r 3.3.0 -t /opt/epics setup
$ bash e3.bash base
$ bash e3.bash req
$ bash e3.bash -c mod
```

## Configuring EPICS base/require versions

Configuration for your local install is done with `e3_building_config.bash`. The usage for this is as follows.

```bash
$ bash e3_building_config.bash -h

Usage    : e3_building_config.bash options setup 

              possbile options

              [-t <target_path>]     [-b <base_version>]      [-r <require_version>] [-c <base_tag>] 
              [-n <ifc14xx_cc_path>] [-m <ifc14xx_cc_version] [-l <poky_cc_path]     [-k <poky_cc_version>] 

               -t : default /epics
               -b : default 7.0.4
               -r : default 3.3.0
               -c : default 7.0.4
               -n : default /opt/ifc14xx
               -m : default 2.6-4.14
               -l : default /opt/cct
               -k : default 2.6-4.14

 bash e3_building_config.bash -t ${HOME} -r 3.3.0 setup
```

The main options to use are the ones listed in the example: `-b` to selecte the version of EPICS base, `-r` to
select the version of `require`, and `-t` to select the desired install location.

The result of this script is the generation of a number of different `.local` files, such as `CONFIG_BASE.local`,
`REQUIRE_CONFIG_MODULE.local`, `RELEASE.local`, and `RELEASE_DEV.local`. These are used to override the configuration
options in the different repositories.
