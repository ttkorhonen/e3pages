# Installing e3

Building EPICS with the so-called *core* modules (to see what the various module groups contain, have a look at the [inventory](https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/e3/e3/-/blob/master/tools/e3-inventory.yaml)) using e3 is fairly easy. Note, however, that the workflow (and tools) listed below typically isn't what you would use for a production build.

## Prerequisites

You should start with a mostly blank CentOS 7 machine, and then install all the necessary packages via the following command.[^prereqlist]

```{include} ../includes/deps.md
```

:::{note}
Note that this package list is more than is strictly needed to install e3, but also contains the necessary packages for many of the e3 modules that are supported.
:::

## Building a local e3 environment

To build EPICS base 7.0.5 with *require* 3.4.1 and the *core* module group and install it at `/opt/epics`, you would only need to run (note `sudo` as we are installing to a subdirectory of `/opt` which generally is owned by `root`):

```console
[iocuser@host:~]$ git clone https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/e3/e3.git
[iocuser@host:~]$ cd e3
[iocuser@host:e3]$ ./e3_building_config.bash -b 7.0.5 -r 3.4.1 -t /opt/epics setup
[iocuser@host:e3]$ sudo ./e3.bash base
[iocuser@host:e3]$ sudo ./e3.bash req
[iocuser@host:e3]$ sudo ./e3.bash -c mod
```

:::{tip}
If you leave out the flags `-b` (version of EPICS base) and `-r` (version of *require*) it will default to the latest stable release, but it's always good practice to be explicit.
:::

As you may realise, this allows a user to have multiple EPICS trees installed at various locations.

## Sourcing a specific e3 environment

With e3, you may have several EPICS environments available, so you need to explicitly activate the e3 environment you intend to use.

```console
[iocuser@host:e3]$ source /path/to/epics/${EPICS_BASE_VERSION}/require/${REQUIRE_VERSION}/bin/setE3Env.bash
```

or, alternatively:

```console
[iocuser@host:e3]$ source /path/to/e3/repository/tools/setenv
```

## Installing an e3 module

To install an existing e3 module in *deployment mode*[^depmode], only a few steps are required. First clone the repository (we will use use the *caenelfastps* module for this example):

```console
[iocuser@host:e3]$ git clone https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/e3/ps/e3-caenelfastps.git
```

Next, modify `configure/RELEASE` to point towards the correct installation path. If you followed the above steps to install, it should look like the following:

```makefile
#
EPICS_BASE:=/opt/epics/base-7.0.5

E3_REQUIRE_NAME:=require
E3_REQUIRE_VERSION:=3.4.1

# The definitions shown below can also be placed in an untracked RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
```

:::{note}
Notice the change to `${EPICS_BASE}` from the default `/epics/base-7.0.5` to `/opt/epics/base-7.0.5`.
:::

Finally, we would run all of the make rules that: clones the submodule, applies patches (if there are any valid ones for this version), builds the module, and finally installs it;

```console
[iocuser@host:e3]$ cd e3-caenelfastps
[iocuser@host:e3-caenelfastps]$ make init patch build
[iocuser@host:e3-caenelfastps]$ sudo make install
```

We should finally validate that everything is working as expected:

```console
# this assumes you have sourced setenv or setE3Env.bash
[iocuser@host:e3-caenelfastps]$ iocsh.bash -r caenelfastps
```

Done!

:::{tip}
If you here wanted to use a different version of the module than the most recent one, you could simply check out a specific commit or tag of the wrapper, prior to running `make init`.

[^prereqlist]: `ethercat-generic-dkms-1.5.2.ESS1-1` is an ESS internal package. It can be found at: <https://artifactory.esss.lu.se/artifactory/rpm-ics/centos/7/x86_64/>. For ESS internal users, this package can be installed the same way as installing standard CentOS packages. For external users, one will need to add this repository to package managerâ€™s repository-search-list to install this package.
[^depmode]: More on this in the e3 tutorial.
