# Communications

At ESS, there is a core e3 team. For issues, feature requests, or questions on e3, either submit these in directly in relevant repositories, or contact one of the previous contributors to core repositories.

## ESS intranet

The main space for e3 is [ESS EPICS Environment (e3) on Confluence](https://confluence.esss.lu.se/x/cUAAFQ). The e3 team also has a [Service Desk](https://jira.esss.lu.se/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/40), and there is a [Slack](https://ess-eric.slack.com) channel, `#e3`, used as a tech-talk channel.

If you do not have an ESS intranet account, you can either report bugs and request features directly in the relevant repository, or otherwise contact one of the previous developers or maintainers.
