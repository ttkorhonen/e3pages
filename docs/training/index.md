# Training

This is a training series for using ESS' EPICS environment [e3](https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/e3/e3). The series assumes at least familiarity with [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org), albeit you may be able to follow along regardless.

---

Note that this workbook is intended for e3 app developers and integrators at ESS (and consequently also contains some site specific processes and standards); if you simply want to use EPICS to read or manipulate PVs you can either run the first two installation commands, or e.g. install EPICS base using conda from conda-forge.
