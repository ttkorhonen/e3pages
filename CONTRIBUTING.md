# Contributing

Improvements to this portal are appreciated, especially if you notice
information or commands being incorrect or out-of-date. If modifying
step-by-steps (such as the training chapters or the How To articles), ensure
that you first try the steps on a fairly blank machine, having performed all the
earlier steps, prior to making the change.

Changes shall as usual be done in a separate branch or on a fork, after which a
pull or merge request can be made. Optimally, you would register an issue in the
repository prior to starting work, and would refer to this in your merge/pull
request.

If you want advice on intended changes, contact one of the earlier contributors.

Make sure to look at the [MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md) prior to starting your
work.
